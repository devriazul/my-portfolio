# Developer Portfolio

![preview](/preview.jpeg)

This Behance UI caught my eye since its release, but I never had the time to complete it. As a part-time hobby project, I’ve finally managed to make the project browsable with static content for now. Being neither a frontend nor a backend expert (known as a full-stack dev 🤡), please pardon any mistakes. I’m opening this repository as public to hand it over to you all to make it perfect! 💖

## Technologies Used

- Vite [v5.1.6]
- React [v18.2.0]
- Typescript [v5.1.6]
- Tailwind CSS [v4-alpha]
  
**Plugins**

- vite-plugin-svgr (To directly import svg as JSX)
- framer-motion
- codemirror (As code previewer and playground)
